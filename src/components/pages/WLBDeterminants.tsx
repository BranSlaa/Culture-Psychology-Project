					Determinants of Work-life Balance
				</h1>
				<InfoPanel title="Determinants across cultures">
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">India</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Studies revealed that job autonomy, perceived workload
						and organisational commitment, gender equality,
						flexibility, stress reduction and child care are
						prominent factors responsible for employee work-life
						balance (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Multinational country companies offered work-life
						related benefits and supported the career development of
						its employees (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Pakistan</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						In a study by Malik and Khalid (2008), long working
						hours and lack of social support are significantly
						correlated with work-life imbalance (Amjad et. al.,
						2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Bankers in Pakistan often work extended hours beyond the
						standard official banking hours, due to “work overload”
						(Amjad et. al., 2019). These extended hours however were
						not found to be directly related to the work-family
						conflict (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						At the University of the Punjab Quaid-e-Azam Campus,
						Lahore, Ullah (2010) found that a supportive workplace
						plays an essential role in work-conflict management.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Rehman and Azam Roomi (2012) found work-life balance was
						a critical motivator to starting one&apos;s own
						business.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Gender bias, insufficient time for family obligations
						and social and cultural norms were among the most vital
						challenges to a patriarchal Islamic society (Amjad et.
						al., 2019).
					</p>
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">China</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Significant factors related to the conflict component of
						work-life balance include working hours, childcare
						responsibilities, organisational family-friendly
						policies and salary (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Spouse Support, new parental experiences and co-workers
						had a significant positive relation with work-life
						balance (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Due to relative values placed on work and family,
						Chinese employees experience higher work demand than
						American employees (Amjad et. al., 2019). This has a
						significant impact on work-life conflict. American
						employees have significantly higher family demand than
						Chinese employees (Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Malaysia</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Noor (2004) found that work salience was significantly
						related to job satisfaction, while exacerbating the
						negative impact of work interface with family conflict.
					</p>
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Singapore</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						Studies found that due to new parenthood, families with
						a single child reported the highest work-family conflict
						while individuals with two or more experienced less
						(Amjad et. al., 2019).
					</p>
					<p className="mb-4">
						As income and education are significantly related to an
						individual&apos;s desire for children, many Singaporeans
						were not inclined to achieve ideal family sizes due to
						financial issues (Amjad et. al., 2019) Additionally
						additional children were related to lower education and
						income.
					</p>
					<h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Europe</h3>
					<p className="mb-4">
						In the EU, Tempo, which is defined as hurridness and
						time pressure, is related to health problems, job
						satisfaction, general well-being and leisure (Antilla
						et. al., 2015).
